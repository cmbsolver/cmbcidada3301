# Observations
- Width and height were pretty much uniform.  Nothing special about them.
- Got basic information, but showed pages with 2 or 3 colors to have in the hundreds of colors.  This is just anti-aliasing?
- The color count stuff amounted to nothing.  Going back and working on some other algos.
- Look at 39 and 40.  After byte processing, see some stuff in Chinese characters.
