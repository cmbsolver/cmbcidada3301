# cmbcicada3301
This is a repo where I am testing out some stuff regarding Liber Primus by Cicada 3301.

# Thoughts
I like steganography so I am putting some stuff together around it.

This will most likely amount to nothing?

# Methodology
I have written a C# program to do this with ImageMagick to generate the files with the information.

# Required Software
- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
- .Net Core 8
- I know a lot of the solvers use Python, but I just prefer C# since I use it most of the time.

# Color Counts
- Looping through the files and getting the count of a certain color and then it will change color, get the number, etc.
- The output will be in the kibana instance that runs in Docker (at least on my box.)
- This amounted to nothing...?

# Winnowing
- It is a technique where there was chafe put in the image.  You pull certain pixels and run them through the image algorithms for processing.
