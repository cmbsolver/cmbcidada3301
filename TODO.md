# TODO
## Menu and screens.
- Add parameter file processing so it can be called in a batch mode.
- Add web project so we can call a subset of the commands from a docker container or just running the web process.
    - May need to add some additional stuff for that one.
- Add a way to do custom sequences from a file.
- Add a linux installer to listen on all interfaces.
- Add brute force checker.
- Put together something to encrypt and embed and image.
- Put in something to possibly detect which kind of encryption.
- Finish out the sequences.
- Add something to bulk rotate the images.  The DCT math will change if we do that as the square quantization changes.
